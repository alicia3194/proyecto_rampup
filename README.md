# My Personal Portfolio Project

## Introduction

This is my first project, where I create a personal webpage using HTML and CSS with a "mobile-first" design approach.

## Requirements
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Mobile-first: Adapted for mobile, tablet, and laptop.
- The website consists of several sections, each implemented in different HTML files.
- Each section has a navigation block for easy user navigation.

## Project Sections
1. Home or Welcome Page (index.html)
   - Contains the navigation block.
   - This is the first page users will see.
2. Biography (biografia.html)
   - Includes text content and at least one image.
3. Portfolio (portfolio.html)
   - New page with multimedia elements (images, videos, audios).
4. Contact (contacto.html)
   - New page with at least one form.

## Iterations
## HTML5

1. Home Page
   - Navigation block.
2. Biography Page
   - Content with text and at least one image.
3. Portfolio Page
   - Multimedia elements.
4. Contact Page
   - At least one form.
5. Semantic HTML5 Tags
   - Review and add all possible semantic tags to HTML files.

## CSS3
1. Custom Typography
   - Use at least one custom font.
2. Selectors
   - Proper use of CSS selectors: element, id, class, compound selectors, etc.
3. Box Model
   - Use margin, padding, border appropriately.
4. Effects
   - Utilize pseudo-classes like Hover, Focus, etc., for dynamic page elements.
   - Use display or visibility properties in combination with pseudo-classes.
5. Page Layouts
   - Use flex to distribute all blocks on your page.
6. Mobile-First Approach
   - Ensure your page looks good on mobile, tablet, and desktop using fluid design, flexbox, and media queries.
